## Comments

### Documentation

Are there any non-public resources? The project description noted that you need
to implement access control, but it seems like the current implementation has
everything being public. Please extend your system to allow for non-public
resources and implement access control.

Please extend your system to include some group-like functionality. Later, we
will ask you to protect your resources even after users are added or removed
from the accessing group. You should be able to support removing a user from a
group and having their access to multiple resources be removed in one step.

### Demo results

Please work on the efficiency of demoing your work, so you can get through the
process in the allotted time. Note that the demo procedure was distributed in
advance so you could prepare.

Very thorough documentation; great work!
